	<p>Scenic is for finding and adding hiking trails. As a non-signed-in user, you are able to browse and search for trails. Once you sign in you are able to rate and favourite trails, as well as mark them as completed. You are also able to add your own trails to the site, and add photos and gpx data to existing trails. Once you have uploaded a trail you become a trailowner, and have admin right over your trails, enabling you to change the location and name of the trail, and edit and delete photos belonging to your trail.</p>

	<p>Scenic was built with Ruby on Rails at the back end, AngularJS at the front end, and is hosted on an Ubuntu droplet running Dokku, the database is Postgresql. The code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/cerico/pennine">https://github.com/cerico/pennine</a></p>
